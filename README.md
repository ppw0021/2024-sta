# About the game

The game is a unique blend of city building and farming elements, offering players a dynamic and engaging experience.

The vision for this game is to have an island city builder where users can creatively customise.​
Each user will have an account unique to them so that their progress can be saved​
The user's data is stored on a server so that the data can accessed anywhere and climates the risk of local data loss
